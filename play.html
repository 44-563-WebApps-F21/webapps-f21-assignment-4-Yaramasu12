    <h3> Vera, or the Nihilists</h3>
    <h4>Antechamber of the CZAR'S private room. Large window at the
        back, with drawn curtains over it.</h4>
    <h6 class="Baron name"> BARON RAFF </h6> <p class="Baron speech" > Ah! General, any more news of our romantic Emperor? </p>

           <h6 class= "GEN name"> GENERAL KOTEMKIN </h6> <p class="GEN speech"> You are quite right to call him romantic, Baron; a week ago
            I found him amusing himself in a garret with a company of strolling
            players; to-day his whim is all the convicts in Siberia are to be
            recalled, and political prisoners, as he calls them, amnestied.</p>
            
            <h6 class="PRINCE name"> PRINCE PETROVITCH </h6> <p class="PRINCE speech"> Political prisoners! Why, half of them are no better than
                common murderers! </p>
            
            <h6 class="COUNT name "> COUNT ROUVALOFF </h6> <p class=" COUNT speech"> And the other half much worse? </p>
            <h6 class="Baron name"> BARON RAFF </h6> <p class="Baron speech" > Oh, you wrong them, surely, Count. Wholesale trade has
                always been more respectable than retail </p>
            <h6 class="COUNT name"> COUNT ROUVALOFF </h6> <p class="COUNT speech" > But he is really too romantic. He objected yesterday to my
                having the monopoly of the salt tax. He said the people had a right to
                have cheap salt </p>
            <h6 class="MARQ name"> MARQUIS DE POIVRARD </h6> <p class="MARQ speech" > h, that's nothing; but he actually disapproved of a
                State banquet every night because there is a famine in the Southern
                provinces </p>
                <p class="stage-direction"> [_The young CZAR enters unobserved, and overhears the rest._] </p>
            <h6 class="PRINCE name"> PRINCE PETROVITCH </h6> <p class="PRINCE speech"> Quelle b√©tise! The more starvation there is among the
                people, the better. It teaches them self-denial, an excellent virtue,
                Baron, an excellent virtue </p>
            <h6 class="Baron name"> BARON RAFF </h6> <p class="Baron speech" > I have often heard so; I have often heard so </p>

    <Pre> BARON RAFF. Ah! General, any more news of our romantic Emperor?

            GEN. KOTEMK. You are quite right to call him romantic, Baron; a week ago
            I found him amusing himself in a garret with a company of strolling
            players; to-day his whim is all the convicts in Siberia are to be
            recalled, and political prisoners, as he calls them, amnestied.
            
            PRINCE PETRO. Political prisoners! Why, half of them are no better than
            common murderers!
            
            COUNT R. And the other half much worse?
            
            BARON RAFF. Oh, you wrong them, surely, Count. Wholesale trade has
            always been more respectable than retail.
            
            COUNT R. But he is really too romantic. He objected yesterday to my
            having the monopoly of the salt tax. He said the people had a right to
            have cheap salt.
            
            MARQ. DE POIV. Oh, that's nothing; but he actually disapproved of a
            State banquet every night because there is a famine in the Southern
            provinces. (_The young CZAR enters unobserved, and overhears the rest._)
            
            PRINCE PETRO. Quelle b√©tise! The more starvation there is among the
            people, the better. It teaches them self-denial, an excellent virtue,
            Baron, an excellent virtue.
            
            BARON RAFF. I have often heard so; I have often heard so.
            </Pre>
